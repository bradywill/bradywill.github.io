Hello.

I'm Brady.

I'm a data scientist, statistician and researcher. I'm currently taking a career break while I search for the next problem to solve.

Most recently, I was a Data Scientist at Amazon in Seattle as part of the [Supply Chain Optimization Technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncwsr1Of6Cw) organisation. I worked on the data science and machine learning behind forecasting customer demand for the hundreds of millions of items sold on Amazon websites and in stores worldwide - you can see some of that work [here](https://www.amazon.science/publications/distribution-free-multi-horizon-forecasting-and-vending-system). I also had a brief stint with the Alexa organisation in Sydney prior to moving to the US, where my focus was on improving regional knowledge and localisation for Australia and New Zealand.

Before joining Amazon, I was a Quantitative Analyst at Westpac Banking Group developing credit risk models, while also completing my Master's degree in Statistics from [University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths) in Sydney. At UNSW, I conducted research into the autoregressive modelling of histograms and probability distributions with [Prof. Scott Sisson](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott/).

I received my Bachelor's and [Honours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree#Australia) degrees in Business and Commerce (majoring in Finance and Macroeconomics) from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/business/) in Gippsland, Victoria. At Monash, I conducted research into the impact of consumer sentiment and business confidence on financial and economic activity in Australia with [Dr. Ernesto Valenzuela](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/evalenzuela) (now at La Trobe Univerisity).
