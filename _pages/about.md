Hello.

I'm Brady.

I'm a data scientist, statistician and researcher. I'm currently taking a career break while I search for the next problem to solve.

Most recently, I spent six years as a Data Scientist at Amazon in Seattle, as part of the [Supply Chain Optimization Technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncwsr1Of6Cw) organization. I worked on the data science and machine learning behind forecasting customer demand for hundreds of millions of items sold on Amazon websites and in stores worldwide. You can see some of the work I did at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/publications/distribution-free-multi-horizon-forecasting-and-vending-system).

Before Amazon, I spent three years as a Quantitative Analyst at Westpac Banking in Sydney developing credit risk models, while also completing my Master's degree in Statistics from University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney. At UNSW, I conducted research into autoregressive modelling of histograms and probability distributions with [Dr. Scott Sisson](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott/).

I received my Bachelor's and [Honours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree#Australia) degrees in Commerce (majoring in Economics and Finance) from Monash University in Gippsland, Victoria. At Monash, I conducted research into the impact of consumer and business sentiment on financial and economic activity in Australia with [Dr. Ernesto Valenzuela](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/evalenzuela).
